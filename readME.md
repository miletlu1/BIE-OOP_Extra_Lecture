This repository serves to share the solutions for the extra exercises. The point is to use scala to its fullest, so if the solutions here
cane be inproved, please, branch out and make a pull request for your answer. The point is to collaborate so we all can learn scala and its OOP
principles.

I'll talk with the professor and get the answers he would find more appropriate. I'll update this with Test cases for each of the exercises, so 
you can understand how the testing with scala works and check how the exercises work. I highly reccomend trying to solve the exercises first, so
it becomes clearer. I'll also upload a PDF of the questions once I have it.
